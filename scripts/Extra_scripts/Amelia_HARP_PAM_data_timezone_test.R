#We computed hourly calling rates within each of these diel periods and subtracted the overall calling rate (calls/hour) for that 24-h day to obtain a mean-adjusted calling rate in order to correct for variation in the total number of calls detected each day. 
#We used a Kruskal-Wallis test (Zar 1999) to rank and compare mean-adjusted calling rates across diel periods, and a Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test to determine which, if any of the diel periods showed significant difference in mean rank of mean-adjusted right whale calling rates.
